                  <h3>Introduction</h3>
                  <p>Hi, my name is Oscar Reyes. I am a creative and enthusiastic software developer with a passion for building innovative software solutions that benefit my community.
                    I am dedicated to contributing strong, supportive ideas to my workplace, always aiming to make a positive impact.</p>
                  <h3>Background and Experience </h3>
                  <p>I am a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Houston Downtown, where I financed 100% of my education by simultaneously working full-time.
                      My professional journey began in hospitality at Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts, where I honed my customer service skills and learned the importance of delivering exceptional experiences.
                      Before that, I spent nearly 15 years at Kraftsman Baking, where I advanced to the role of Accounts & Operations Manager.
                      In this role, I played a crucial part in the company's financial health by clearing over $248,000 in uncollected debt and increasing annual profits by 15%.
                      I also led operational improvements by updating and customizing company software, which significantly contributed to the business's growth.
                      My academic background in Computer Science, coupled with hands-on experience in managing operations and finances, has shaped me into a versatile professional capable of adapting to dynamic environments.
                      I am now eager to leverage my technical skills and innovative mindset to drive success in a challenging and dynamic environment.</p>
                  <h3>Story</h3>
                  <p>I am originally from Jalisco, Mexico, famous for its Tequila. As a first-generation college graduate, I encountered challenges in choosing the right path and discovering my true passion.
                     However, my determination and goal-oriented mindset have enabled me to excel in every role I've held, consistently exceeding expectations.
                     These qualities have also pushed me out of my comfort zone, encouraging me to take risks and bet on myself.
                     Ultimately, I discovered that software development is my true passion and the career I am committed to pursuing long-term. </p>
                  <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                  <p>When I'm not working, you'll likely find me camping in the woods, hiking with my dog, or spending quality time with my wife and family.
                     I also have a small craving for adrenaline, which I occasionally satisfy through skydiving, mountain biking, or other exciting outdoor activities.
                     Being immersed in nature helps me stay grounded and inspired.</p>
                  <h3>Thanks for Visiting!</h3>
                  <p>I'd love to connect with you!
                     Whether you have a question about software development, are interested in collaborating on a project, any job opportunities or just want to chat, feel free to reach out.</p>
